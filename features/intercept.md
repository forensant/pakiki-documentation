# Intercept

The intercept pane is where you can request that PƒÅkiki halt in-flight requests and awaits your input on whether to forward them as-is, modify them, or drop them.

As requests are received from the web browser, they enter the request queue within the intercept pane. You can either forward/modify each request individually in the order they came in, or select a particular request to interact with.

Multiple requests can be selected to either forward or drop multiple at once.
