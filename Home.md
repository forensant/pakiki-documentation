# Welcome

Pākiki is an intercepting proxy designed to help find security vulnerabilities within web applications. You can use it to intercept and manipulate traffic between your web browser and the servers. Pākiki runs on both Linux and MacOS and is available in both an Open Source community edition and a Professional edition. Windows will be supported in the future.

 > Remember: It is a crime to attempt to find/exploit vulnerabilities in sites for which you don't have permission from the owner. Do not be wreckless as to whether you have permission, and ensure you only use this tool on sites you have explicit permission to test. Strictly stay within any scope given, including that of bug bounty programs. The penalties can be serious depending on your jurisdiction.

## Why Pākiki

Pākiki provides the common tools required for penetration testing in a way that is easy to use for both people new to penetration testing and experienced people alike.

What sets us apart from the alternatives?
  * **Native User Interfaces** - Each platform has a fully custom user interface which uses the native platform technologies. This means that it integrates fully with your desktop, doesn't look or feel out of place, and can take full advantage of the platform-specific features. The relevant human interface guidelines are adhered to. As the native platforms are used, this also means that Pākiki can make more efficient use of system resources.
  * **Open Source Core** - The core code which powers all versions of Pākiki is open source. Depending on what you're doing, it can be important to fully understand what requests will be made to a target and how. You can understand how the proxy is working under the hood, even for the professional versions. This is also our way of giving back to the community.
  * **Opinionated Feature Set** - Some other tools attempt to provide every feature to everybody. In some cases, we're explicitly not including support for some features, especially where other well-established tools do the job better than we could build into Pākiki. We instead would rather provide the ability to call out to those tools, or provide a script which will do the basic functionality, but provide instructions on how to use the dedicated tools if the scripts do not achieve the results you want.
  * **Scripting (Pro only)** - The professional version of Pākiki provides a full scripting engine where you can either run pre-built scripts or write your own in Python.
